## 2.1 Homicide Data Import and Cleaning

Let us begin by importing the CSV file containing *Washington Post’s*
homicide data downloaded from GitHub, and applying the `clean_names`
function. Next, we can create a new `city_state` variable
(e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) by joining the existing city and state variables
using the `paste` command, and a new binary `homicide_solved` variable
indicating whether a homicide is solved. The `victim_age` variable
previously read as a character variable is transformed into a numeric
variable. Finally, we filtered the data to exclude information from
Dallas, TX, Phoenix, AZ, Kansas City, MD, and Tulsa, AL, and to only
include victims whose reported race was White or Black.

``` r
homicide_data = 
  read_csv("./homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(city_state = as.character(paste(city, state, sep = ", ")), 
         homicide_solved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0), 
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>% 
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoeniz, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")), 
         victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"))
```

## 2.2 Homicide Data Analysis: Odds Ratios & 95% CIs

#### *Solved Homicides Comparing Male & Female Victims in Baltimore, MD*

Below we use the `glm` function to estimate the odds ratio of solved
homicides comparing male to female victims, specifically in Baltimore,
MD, adjusting for age and race. The arguments for the `glm` function
indicate that the `homicide_solved` variable is the outcome of interest,
and `victim_age`, `victim_sex` and `victim_race` are the predictors.

The output generated from the `glm` function is then saved as an R
object. The `broom::tidy()` function was applied to tidy the output, and
the log odds ratios, odds ratios, and p-value corresponding to each term
in the regression model were pulled and tabulated. In the final step,
the `confint` function was applied to the output generated from the
`glm` function to generate the 95% confidence intervals surrounding the
odds ratios.

``` r
homicide_data_df = homicide_data %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

glm_homicide_baltimore = 
  homicide_data_df %>% 
  glm(homicide_solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial())

glm_homicide_baltimore %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(odds_ratio = exp(estimate), 
         lower_CI = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error), 
         upper_CI = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)) %>%
  select(term, odds_ratio, lower_CI, upper_CI) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c('Term', 'Odds Ratio', 'Lower 95% CI Limit', 'Upper 95% CI Limit'), digits = 3)
```

| Term           | Odds Ratio | Lower 95% CI Limit | Upper 95% CI Limit |
|:---------------|-----------:|-------------------:|-------------------:|
| victim_sexMale |      0.426 |              0.325 |              0.558 |

In Baltimore, MD, the odds ratio of solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims, adjusting for age and race, was 0.456. We are
95% confident that the true odds ratio of solving homicides comparing
male and female victims, adjusting for age and race, lies between 0.340
and 0.612.

#### *Solved Homicides Comparing Male & Female Victims in All Cities*

We will now apply the `glm` function to all cities in the data set. This
process involves first creating a new `glm_homicide` function, which
applies the `glm` function to selected inputs. We then use the `select`
function to reorder the columns in the data frame to have `city_state`
appear first, as the function will be mapped to each unique
`city_state`. The city-level homicide data will then be nested using the
`nest` function to generate list columns for city-level homicide counts,
and the `glm_homicide` function will be mapped to each tibble using
`purrr::map`. Finally, we apply the `unnest` function to generate the
city-specific odds ratio and 95% CIs.

``` r
glm_homicide = function(homicide_data) {
  glm(homicide_solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = homicide_data, family = binomial()) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(odds_ratio = exp(estimate), 
         lower_CI = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error), 
         upper_CI = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)) %>%
  select(term, odds_ratio, lower_CI, upper_CI) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale")
}

homicide_data_analysis = homicide_data %>% 
  select(city_state, everything()) %>% 
  nest(data = uid:homicide_solved) %>% 
  mutate(glm_homicide_output = purrr::map(.x = data, ~ glm_homicide(.x))) %>% 
  unnest(cols = glm_homicide_output)
```

#### *Plotting City-Specific Solved Homicides Comparing Male & Female Victims*

using the generated output from the analysis above, we will plot the
city-level odds ratio estimates of unsolved homicides comparing male to
female victims and corresponding 95% CIs using `ggplot`. In addition to
plotting the OR estimates using `geom_point`, the 95% confidence
intervals associated with each estimate were applied using
`geom_errorbar`. Cities are ordered in increasing OR estimates of
unsolved homicides, comparing male to female victims.

``` r
homicide_data_analysis %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(city_state, odds_ratio), y = odds_ratio, color = city_state)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_CI, ymax = upper_CI)) +
  labs(
    title = "City-Level Odds Ratio Estimates and 95% CIs for Unsolved Homicides Comparing Male to Female Victims", 
    x = "City, State", 
    y = "Odds Ratio Estimate") + 
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 70, hjust = 1), 
    legend.position = "none")
```

# Problem 3

## 3.1 Birth Weight Data Import and Cleaning

Let us begin by importing the CSV file containing birth weight data, and
applying the `clean_names` function. The following variables were
converted from numeric to factor variables to reflect the information in
the codebook: `babysex`, `frace`, `malform`, and `mrace`. Labels were
applied to these newly converted factor variables to improve readability
of these data. Please note that although the provided codebook indicated
that the `frace` and `mrace` variables had 6 and 5 possible values,
respectively, the actual data set only contained 5 and 4 possible values
for each variable respectively. More specifically, `frace` did not have
any entries with 9 = Unknown, and `mrace` did not have any entries with
8 = Other. As such, these labels were omitted in the labeling process.
The `fincome` variable, denoting family monthly income, was also
modified to reflect the actual reported amounts (i.e., hundreds).
Finally, the `skim` function was applied to generate a summary of the
variables in the data set.

``` r
birthweight_data = 
  read_csv("./birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(babysex = factor(babysex, labels = c("Male", "Female")),
         fincome = fincome * 100, 
         frace = factor(frace, labels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican", "Other")),
         malform = factor(malform, labels = c("Absent", "Present")),
         mrace = factor(mrace, labels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican")))
```

## 3.2 Birth Weight Data Analysis: Modeling Exercise

#### *Hypothesizing a Regression Model for Birth Weight*

According to the CDC, about 20% of babies born to mothers who smoke
during their pregnancy are born with low birth weight (2020).
Furthermore, existing literature has found increased maternal age to be
a risk factor for low birth weight (Zheng et al., 2016). As such, we
hypothesize that birth weight has an inverse linear relationship with
the average number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy
(variable `smoken`) and maternal age (variable `momage`). Below, we fit
this hypothesized model, and depict a plot of model residuals against
fitted values using `add_residuals` and `add_predictions`.

``` r
birthweight_smoken_momage_fit = lm(bwt ~ momage + smoken, data = birthweight_data)

birthweight_smoken_momage_fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c('Term', 'Estimate', 'Standard Error', 'Statistic', 'p-value'), digits = 3)
```

| Term        | Estimate | Standard Error | Statistic | p-value |
|:------------|---------:|---------------:|----------:|--------:|
| (Intercept) | 2757.689 |         40.916 |    67.399 |       0 |
| momage      |   18.792 |          1.985 |     9.469 |       0 |
| smoken      |   -5.971 |          1.039 |    -5.747 |       0 |

``` r
birthweight_data_df = birthweight_data %>% 
  mutate(modelr::add_residuals(birthweight_data, birthweight_smoken_momage_fit), 
         modelr::add_predictions(birthweight_data, birthweight_smoken_momage_fit))

birthweight_data_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw6_hw2852_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

#### *Fitting Comparison Models*

In subsequent analysis, we will compare the hypothesized model described
above with the following 2 models:

1)  One using length at birth (`blength`) and gestational age
    (`gaweeks`) as predictors (main effects only); and
2)  One using head circumference (`bhead`), length (`blength`), sex
    (`babysex`), and all interactions (including the three-way
    interaction) between these.

These two comparison models are fitted below in the following code.

``` r
birthweight_blength_gaweeks_fit = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight_data)

birthweight_bhead_blength_sex_fit = lm(bwt ~ (bhead + blength + babysex)^4, data = birthweight_data)
```

#### *Comparing Regression Models: Cross-Validated Prediction Error*

We can now perform a comparison between the three models in terms of
cross-validated prediction error. To do this, we first create a
cross-validation data frame `cv_df`. Contained within `cv_df` is 2
side-by-side list columns with the testing and training data split
pairs, with a corresponding ID number for each pair. Since we are able
to apply resample objects directly into `lm` functions, we can skip the
extra step of converting the testing and training data into tibbles.
Next, we apply the `map` function to map each regression model to the
training data. Finally, we can compute the root mean squared errors
(RMSEs) for each model by applying the `map2_dbl` function to the
testing data.

``` r
cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(birthweight_data_df, 100)

cv_df = cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    smoke_momage_mod      = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ momage + smoken, data = .x)), 
    blength_gaweeks_mod   = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)), 
    bhead_blength_sex_mod = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ (bhead + blength + babysex)^4, data = .x))) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_smoke_momage      = map2_dbl(.x = smoke_momage_mod, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)), 
    rmse_blength_gaweeks   = map2_dbl(.x = blength_gaweeks_mod, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)), 
    rmse_bhead_blength_sex = map2_dbl(.x = bhead_blength_sex_mod, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))
```

Using the output from the code above, we can see which of the three
models is the best fit for birth weight data by plotting the
distribution of RMSEs generated from each model. This process involves
first tidying the data using `pivot_longer`, then using `ggplot` and
`geom_violin` to generate a violin plot.

``` r
cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(), 
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse", 
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) +
  geom_violin() + 
  labs(
    title = "Root Mean Squared Errors Distributions for Fitted Birth Weight Models", 
    x = "Fitted Model", 
    y = "RMSE") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("bhead_blength_sex" = "Head Circ, Length, Sex Model", 
                              "blength_gaweeks" = "Length, Gestational Age Model", 
                              "smoke_momage" = "Smoke, Maternal Age Model"))
```

![](p8105_hw6_hw2852_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->
Based on the distributions depicted above, we can conclude that the
model with head circumference, length, sex and all interactions between
those variables is able to generate better predictions than the model
with length and gestational age, and the model with smoking and maternal
age. Having said that, however, due to the very large RMSEs generated
from all three fitted models, none of the three generate especially
accurate predictions on birth weight. This is likely due to the fact
that birth weight is affected by a myriad of factors that were unable to
be captured in the three models above. Such factors include, but are
certainly not limited to, environmental determinants, genetic
predispositions, and pregnancy diet. In order to generate a better
fitted model to predict birth weight, several additional predictors
should be included in future analyses.
