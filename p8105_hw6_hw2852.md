libraries:

``` r

## 2.1 Homicide Data Import and Cleaning

Let us begin by importing the CSV file containing *Washington Post’s*
homicide data downloaded from GitHub, and applying the `clean_names`
function. Next, we can create a new `city_state` variable
(e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) by joining the existing city and state variables
using the `paste` command, and a new binary `homicide_solved` variable
indicating whether a homicide is solved. The `victim_age` variable
previously read as a character variable is transformed into a numeric
variable. Finally, we filtered the data to exclude information from
Dallas, TX, Phoenix, AZ, Kansas City, MD, and Tulsa, AL, and to only
include victims whose reported race was White or Black.

``` r
homicide_data = 
  read_csv("./homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(city_state = as.character(paste(city, state, sep = ", ")), 
         homicide_solved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0), 
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>% 
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoeniz, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")), 
         victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"))
```

## 2.2 Homicide Data Analysis: Odds Ratios & 95% CIs

#### *Solved Homicides Comparing Male & Female Victims in Baltimore, MD*

Below we use the `glm` function to estimate the odds ratio of solved
homicides comparing male to female victims, specifically in Baltimore,
MD, adjusting for age and race. The arguments for the `glm` function
indicate that the `homicide_solved` variable is the outcome of interest,
and `victim_age`, `victim_sex` and `victim_race` are the predictors.

The output generated from the `glm` function is then saved as an R
object. The `broom::tidy()` function was applied to tidy the output, and
the log odds ratios, odds ratios, and p-value corresponding to each term
in the regression model were pulled and tabulated. In the final step,
the `confint` function was applied to the output generated from the
`glm` function to generate the 95% confidence intervals surrounding the
odds ratios.

``` r
homicide_data_df = homicide_data %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

glm_homicide_baltimore = 
  homicide_data_df %>% 
  glm(homicide_solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial())

glm_homicide_baltimore %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(odds_ratio = exp(estimate), 
         lower_CI = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error), 
         upper_CI = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)) %>%
  select(term, odds_ratio, lower_CI, upper_CI) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c('Term', 'Odds Ratio', 'Lower 95% CI Limit', 'Upper 95% CI Limit'), digits = 3)
```

| Term           | Odds Ratio | Lower 95% CI Limit | Upper 95% CI Limit |
|:---------------|-----------:|-------------------:|-------------------:|
| victim_sexMale |      0.426 |              0.325 |              0.558 |

In Baltimore, MD, the odds ratio of solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims, adjusting for age and race, was 0.456. We are
95% confident that the true odds ratio of solving homicides comparing
male and female victims, adjusting for age and race, lies between 0.340
and 0.612.
